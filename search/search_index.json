It is a is a simple tool to assist an Architect in designing a solution by finding the best/relevant/potential architectural solutions and/or patterns and customizing them for client specific needs. There is a commercialized version of this internal IBM app called IBM IT Architect Assistant that is available to clients as a SaaS solution. Key Features and Functions: The features of the web-based application include: a. A personal workspace where users can manage the Solution architectures they are working on with their colleagues or vendors. An architecture can be created from scratch or can be created by copying an existing architecture asset. b. Each architecture asset is structured in a standard form allowing for consistent documentation and reuse. Individual artifacts can be easily added and customized for the user\u2019s solutions. In addition to each user's private workspace (repository), there is a public, searchable repository with a growing set of assets including Reference Architectures, Architectural Patterns and Solution Architectures ready for reuse and customization. A user is also able to permit other users to discover their private assets via search by self-publishing them \u2018as-is\u2019. Key Benefits, Savings from using the asset 1) Reduce time for finding proven solution alternatives resulting in value of time saved and increased revenue potential. 2) Reduce time for creating architectures through tool simplicity and easy reuse of existing architectural assets. 3) Facilitates collaboration amongst a team of architects working on a solution. 4) Improve Quality through consistency by reusing proven solution alternatives. 5) Enable Knowledge Transfer from proven solution alternatives.

We need to decide which cluster type should be used for now. Assumptions \u00b6 Motivation \u00b6 Notes \u00b6 Expand all Alternatives \u00b6 Classic Name Classic Description Clusters on classic infrastructure include all the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud mature and robust features for compute, networking, and storage. Security: Classic clusters have many built-in security features that help you protect your cluster infrastructure, isolate resources, and ensure security compliance. High availability: the master includes three replicas for high availability. Cluster Network: Communication to the cluster master can be on the public or private cloud service endpoint. App Network: All pods are routed between worker nodes on the worker node private IP address of the private VLAN. To expose the app on the public network, your cluster must have worker nodes on the public VLAN. Then, you can create a NodePort, LoadBalancer (NLB), or Ingress (ALB) service. Storage: Can choose from non-persistent and persistent storage solutions such as file, block, object, and software-defined storage. We use file stroage in our extenal envs, file stroage is suitable for: - Mix of structured and unstructured data - Shared data with many users at once Best Applied Can support File Storage Contraindications VPC Name VPC Description With VPC, you can create your cluster in the next generation of the IBM Cloud platform, in your Virtual Private Cloud. VPC gives you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud, with the ability to deploy your cluster worker nodes as generation 2 compute virtual servers. Security: With VPC, your cluster runs in an isolated environment in the public cloud. Network access control lists protect the subnets that provide the floating IPs for your worker nodes. High availability: the master includes three replicas for high availability. Cluster networking: Unlike classic infrastructure, the worker nodes of your VPC cluster are attached to VPC subnets and assigned private IP addresses. The worker nodes are not connected to the public network, which instead is accessed through a public gateway, floating IP, or VPN gateway. App networking: All pods are routed between worker nodes on the worker node private IP address of the private VPC subnet. To expose the app on the public network, you can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service, which provisions a VPC load balancer and public hostname address for your worker nodes. Storage: For persistent storage, use block, but block storage is best suited for static files that aren\u2019t changed often because any change made to a file results in the creation of a new object. Best Applied Contraindications Decision \u00b6 Classic Justification \u00b6 Platform Consistency, Multi Tenant use Classic Cluster now; - VPC cluster only provided VPC Block Storage, but Block Storage is best suited for static files that aren\u2019t changed often because any change made to a file results in the creation of a new object.

Security: Classic clusters have many built-in security features that help you protect your cluster infrastructure, isolate resources, and ensure security compliance. High availability: the master includes three replicas for high availability. Cluster Network: Communication to the cluster master can be on the public or private cloud service endpoint. App Network: All pods are routed between worker nodes on the worker node private IP address of the private VLAN. To expose the app on the public network, your cluster must have worker nodes on the public VLAN. Then, you can create a NodePort, LoadBalancer (NLB), or Ingress (ALB) service. Storage: Can choose from non-persistent and persistent storage solutions such as file, block, object, and software-defined storage. We use file stroage in our extenal envs, file stroage is suitable for: - Mix of structured and unstructured data - Shared data with many users at once Best Applied Can support File Storage Contraindications VPC Name VPC Description With VPC, you can create your cluster in the next generation of the IBM Cloud platform, in your Virtual Private Cloud. VPC gives you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud, with the ability to deploy your cluster worker nodes as generation 2 compute virtual servers. Security: With VPC, your cluster runs in an isolated environment in the public cloud. Network access control lists protect the subnets that provide the floating IPs for your worker nodes. High availability: the master includes three replicas for high availability. Cluster networking: Unlike classic infrastructure, the worker nodes of your VPC cluster are attached to VPC subnets and assigned private IP addresses. The worker nodes are not connected to the public network, which instead is accessed through a public gateway, floating IP, or VPN gateway. App networking: All pods are routed between worker nodes on the worker node private IP address of the private VPC subnet. To expose the app on the public network, you can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service, which provisions a VPC load balancer and public hostname address for your worker nodes. Storage: For persistent storage, use block, but block storage is best suited for static files that aren\u2019t changed often because any change made to a file results in the creation of a new object.
