### Name

Implement Pub-Sub Pattern

### Status

proposed

### Last Update

### Subject Area



### Topic



### Issue or Problem Statement

1) Every event will have a dedicated topic where it will be published<div>2) Microservices will be subscribed to the event topic of interest</div><div>3) Process rules can no longer be changed without downtime so a new design has to be set to replace the process rules concept</div><div>4) A single consumer in a microservice (as the notification service) can listen to multiple event topics</div><div>5) Backlog for a single consumer to multiple topics can be eliminated by horizontal scaling</div><div>6) Each microservice can have multiple consumer groups to serve multiple purposes</div><div>7) ELK can subscriber to the event topics directly without the notification service involved? The goal is to treat ELK as an external system and receive events only from notification microservice.</div><div>8) The number of topics might explode due to the number of events</div><div>9) Events for the same purpose such as missing, retry and failed for the same feature can be emitted on the same topic</div><div>10) Implementing the pub/sub should involve a load redistribution which will result in performance boost.</div><div>11) Notification microservice will start receiving events in a more real-time approach (example: it will not depend on event handler to produce a new event, â€¦)</div>

### Assumptions



### Motivation

Improve the system's performance, better handling of the system resources, more control on scalability.
