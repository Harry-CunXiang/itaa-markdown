### Decision




### Justification

1. MxGraph can support complex drawing elements and easy to do customization, besides of that, MxGraph also provides us the base framework of palette, properties windows, menu.<br>2. MxGraph supports mobile browser with enhanced events/user experience<br>3. MxGraph support offline edit and save<br>4. MxGraph is open source


### Implications

1. MxGraph does not support multiple user collaboration, needs to develop from scratch on it in the future.
2. MxGraph UI is not attractive, needs to customize the UI theme
